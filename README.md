DLJeopardy
==========

DLJeopardy as you see it is the third in a long line of Jeopardy-esque games intended for 
classroom instruction. This website offers moderated classroom-style version of the game 
with the teacher directing the progress of the game and students competing for correct answers. 
There is complete flexibility on the part of the moderator to move between game boards and 
assign answers to players or teams.

The game may be run from a central display with the moderator controlling on a separate 
computer, or each player may have their own terminal to view the game. In either case, the 
moderator sees more information than should be visible to the players and so should not display 
their own screen.

Moderator View
--------------

The moderator is the only user able to control the flow of the game. They see details of each 
answered question and select what the players see on their screens.

Player View
-----------

Users do not need to log in or register to join or view games. When a player enters a game, 
they are presented with the option to "Join" the game, registering their website session 
with that particular game and selecting a display name visible to the moderator.

Players only see the current state of the game and have no means of controlling or answering questions.
