			<p>
				DLJeopardy as you see it is the third in a long line of Jeopardy-esque games intended for classroom instruction.
				This website offers moderated classroom-style version of the game with the teacher directing the progress of the
				game and students competing for correct answers. There is complete flexibility on the part of the moderator to
				move between game boards and assign answers to players or teams.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game may be run from a central display with the moderator controlling on a separate computer, or each player
				may have their own terminal to view the game. In either case, the moderator sees more information than should
				be visible to the players and so should not display their own screen.

			<h3>Moderator View</h3>
			<p>
				The moderator is the only user able to control the flow of the game. They see details of each answered question 
				and select what the players see on their screens.

			<h3>Player View</h3>
			<p>
				Users do not need to log in or register to join or view games. When a player enters a game, they are presented with
				the option to "Join" the game, registering their website session with that particular game and selecting a display
				name visible to the moderator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Players only see the current state of the game and have no means of controlling or answering questions.
